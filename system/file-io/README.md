# File Input/Output

Learn to read and write text and binary files.

## Text file: Drop every second character

Read the text file `text-drop-each-2nd-character.txt`, and write it's content to stdout, dropping every second character.

Example: If the file contains “HMeMlMlMoM”, then your program should output “Hello”.

## Binary file: Reverse

Read the binary file "reverse-me.fdp" and produce a file "reversed.pdf" that contains the same content, but in reverse.

(The order of bits inside each bytes stays.)

Example: You have the bytes `03 07 01`, then afterwards it should be `01 07 03`.

# Test
